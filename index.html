            <p>I was born and raised in Hawaii a very long time ago. My family lived in small 2 bed, 1 bath grass shack on the beach. I spent my days climbing coconut trees and sunbathing on the beach. For fun we would ride wild boars through the forest and cliff dive into 1 foot deep ponds. Once during a fishing trip I hooked a humpback whale. It pulled the boat for 5 days and we navigated around the entire island chain, ending where we had begun!</p>
            <p>I bored of the island life, and looking to make my fortune in tech I moved to Seattle. Unfortunately there was no fortune to be made as the dot com bust derailed my plans. I took odd jobs to make ends meet and resumed by education. I finally attained my BSEE from the University of Washington. Upon graduation I started a career in aerospace as a test engineer. This was a demanding job and was difficult on my family so I tried my hand in consumer electronics. I did not find what I was looking for, so here I am trying to reinvent myself.</p>
